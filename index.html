<h1>Angel Aguila</h1>
<p>I am Angel Aguila, a current student at Cerritos College with the goal of completing 2 years of CS courses. My short term goals for this year include having have made a small project that I am happy with in any programming language as well as receiving a good cumulative GPA in the classes I will attend in the future. For the long term, I plan on becoming a full time software engineer at a big company like Google, while coding on the side every now and then for personal projects. All in all, I am excited for what the future holds; not only for me, but for CS as a whole. </p>
<h1>When I have free time</h1>
 <ol>
  <li>Playing video games on my computer</li>
  <li>Watching movies with my family</li>
  <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
</ol> 
<p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> because it can be just as educational as it is entertaining.</p>
